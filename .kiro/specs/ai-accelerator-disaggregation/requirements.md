# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This research project aims to develop **Genie**, a semantic-driven framework-level disaggregation system for AI accelerators that bridges the "semantic translation gap" in current disaggregation approaches. The system will operate at the ML framework level (PyTorch) to capture rich semantic context and orchestrate efficient execution across local and remote accelerators, addressing the fundamental inefficiency of current tightly-coupled server-accelerator architectures where GPUs remain idle 55-60% of the time.

### Problem Statement

Current disaggregation approaches operate at low levels (PCIe, driver, or application-specific) and lack semantic understanding of AI workloads, leading to:
- Inefficient resource utilization (55-60% GPU idle time)
- Suboptimal data movement patterns
- Inability to leverage workload-specific optimizations
- High CPU overhead at remote accelerator nodes

### Solution Overview

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Genie is a semantic-driven, framework-level disaggregation system that operates at the PyTorch “narrow waist” to bridge the semantic translation gap between application intent and infrastructure execution. By transforming eager execution into deferred, semantically-rich graphs and executing them over a zero-copy user-space data path, Genie targets efficient remote execution while keeping remote accelerator nodes CPU-minimal.

Motivation from the proposal:
- The semantic translation gap causes lower layers to be semantically blind, leading to poor decisions.
- The ML framework layer uniquely preserves semantic richness while remaining general.
- Deferred execution plus zero-copy networking enables just-in-time, intent-aware placement with minimal overhead.

### Success Metrics

- Performance: ≥30% reduction in network bytes transferred; ≥15% end-to-end latency reduction vs. baseline disaggregation
- Efficiency: Support ≥8:1 GPU-to-CPU ratio at remote nodes (e.g., 8×H100 per 2 CPU cores, 8GB RAM)
- Overhead: ≤5% total overhead for semantic capture, analysis, and lazy execution
- Correctness: Numerical parity within 1e-5 vs. local execution; determinism for fixed seeds
- Generality: LLMs, Vision, RecSys, and Multi-modal workloads supported without app code changes
