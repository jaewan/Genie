## Short Priority Guide

Weeks 5–6 (Semantic): 4.1, 5.1–5.2, Synchronization + Version negotiation

Weeks 7–8 (Optimization): 7.1, 8.1, 2.5.2

## Failure Injection Testing Plan

Purpose: Validate resilience, observability, and graceful degradation under realistic faults. Each test must emit telemetry and meet recovery/penalty budgets from requirements.

### Network Faults (R3.4, R5.1, R7.3)
- Packet loss/burst drops: Introduce 1–5% random loss and 100ms burst loss; verify throughput degradation is tracked and retries occur; ensure no deadlocks.
- Latency spikes/jitter: Inject p95 latency +2× for 10s; verify overlap scheduling maintains progress; end-to-end SLA hit ≤15%.
- Partition and heal: Drop connectivity for 5s; confirm fallback to local or queued execution and recovery within 5s with no data corruption.

### Resource Exhaustion (R3.1, R3.5, R7.1)
- DPDK pool exhaustion: Cap pools to trigger fragmentation/exhaustion at 80–95% utilization; verify compaction triggers and spill strategies; no crashes.
- GPU OOM: Force reduced memory limits; validate recomputation/offload engages; report recovery with ≤30% slowdown.
- CPU pressure on remote: Saturate 1 core; ensure control/telemetry channel still meets p95 <2ms; backpressure applied to planner.

### Pattern/System Semantics (R2, R4, R8)
- Low-confidence patterns: Force classifier confidence <70%; verify conservative path is selected, telemetry logged, and results match within 1e-5.
- FX tracer failure: Disable FX on selected models; hooks-only capture must still function with overhead ≤1%.
- Recompute vs transfer: Inject inaccurate cost hints and ensure guardrails bound overhead increase to ≤5% vs. baseline plan.

Artifacts
- Fault profiles checked into repo (yaml/json) with seeds for reproducibility.
- CI job “resilience” runs nightly on smallest matrix; weekly on full matrix.
- Dashboards include failure-rate, MTTR, fallback-usage, and penalty metrics.
