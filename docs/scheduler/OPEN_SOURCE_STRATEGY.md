# Djinn Scheduler: Open Source Strategy

**Status**: Planning Phase - Implementation Dependencies
**Last Updated**: November 10, 2025
**Note**: Strategy dependent on resolving core LazyTensor interception and operation handler completeness issues

---

## Executive Summary

### Current Architecture 
The Djinn scheduler operates **client-side** for semantic analysis, extracting hints that are passed to the model cache system for efficient execution. This separation eliminates graph transfer overhead while preserving semantic intelligence.

### Key Architectural Changes
- **Scheduler Role**: Client-side semantic analysis (not graph execution planning)
- **Execution Model**: Model cache executes directly (model.forward(), no graph reconstruction)
- **Performance**: 303x faster than old graph-based system
- **Network Efficiency**: 99.7% reduction in network transfer

### Implementation Status
- ✅ Scheduler integrated with model cache system
- ✅ Semantic hint extraction and protocol implemented
- ✅ Phase-aware memory management integrated server-side
- ✅ Production performance validated (GPT-2-XL: 10.7x faster)

## Adoption Barrier Analysis

### §1. Complexity Assessment

#### Technical Complexity Levels

**Level 1: Basic Scheduling (80% of workloads)**
- Simple device placement
- Basic load balancing
- Minimal semantic awareness
- **Target**: Works out-of-the-box for most PyTorch models

**Level 2: Semantic Scheduling (15% of workloads)**
- Phase-aware placement (prefill vs decode)
- Stateful co-location (KV cache + decoder)
- Cost-based decision making
- **Target**: Requires minimal configuration for LLM/CNN workloads

**Level 3: Advanced Optimization (5% of workloads)**
- Custom cost models
- Multi-device orchestration
- Memory pressure adaptation
- **Target**: Requires ML performance engineering expertise

#### Current Adoption Barriers (Post-Redesign)

1. **System Stability** (Mostly Resolved)
   - ✅ Model cache eliminates graph transfer issues
   - ✅ Direct model.forward() execution avoids graph reconstruction problems
   - ⚠️ LazyTensor interception still needed for SRG construction (client-side only)
   - ⚠️ Operation handler coverage for semantic analysis (not execution)

2. **Configuration Complexity**
   - Cost model calibration requires domain expertise (optional, for advanced users)
   - Network topology configuration for multi-device (optional)
   - Memory budget tuning via phase-aware memory (automatic, can be tuned)

3. **Integration Complexity**
   - Model cache setup (one-time registration per model)
   - Multi-device coordination (via scheduler placement hints)
   - Monitoring and observability (phase detection, cache stats)

## Recommended Implementation Strategy

### Option A: Progressive Configuration (Recommended)

#### Architecture Overview

```python
class AdaptiveScheduler:
    """Scheduler that adapts complexity to user needs and workload characteristics."""

    def __init__(self, mode='auto'):
        self.mode = mode  # 'auto', 'basic', 'semantic', 'advanced'
        self.capabilities = self._detect_environment()
        self.strategies = self._select_strategies()

    def _detect_environment(self):
        """Detect deployment environment and user sophistication."""
        return {
            'devices': self._count_available_devices(),
            'network_topology': self._analyze_network(),
            'workload_type': self._infer_workload_type(),
            'expertise_level': self._estimate_user_expertise(),
        }

    def _select_strategies(self):
        """Select appropriate optimization strategies based on capabilities."""
        if self.mode == 'auto':
            return self._auto_configure_strategies()
        return self._manual_strategy_selection()
```

#### Auto-Configuration Logic

**Environment-Aware Strategy Selection:**
```python
def _auto_configure_strategies(self):
    """Automatically select optimal strategies for detected environment."""

    strategies = []

    # Basic load balancing for all environments
    strategies.append(LoadBalancingStrategy())

    # Add semantic optimizations if capable
    if self.capabilities['workload_type'] in ['llm', 'cnn', 'multimodal']:
        strategies.append(SemanticOptimizationStrategy())

    # Add advanced optimizations for multi-device setups
    if self.capabilities['devices'] > 1:
        strategies.append(MultiDeviceOptimizationStrategy())

    # Add memory optimizations if memory pressure detected
    if self._detect_memory_pressure():
        strategies.append(MemoryAwareOptimizationStrategy())

    return strategies
```

**Progressive Feature Enablement:**
```python
class ProgressiveScheduler:
    """Scheduler that enables features progressively based on usage patterns."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.usage_stats = {}
        self.feature_flags = self._get_default_flags()

    def _get_default_flags(self):
        """Start with conservative defaults, enable progressively."""
        return {
            'cost_estimation': True,      # Always enabled (core functionality)
            'semantic_optimization': False,  # Enable after successful basic usage
            'memory_optimization': False,   # Enable under memory pressure
            'advanced_optimization': False, # Enable for power users
        }

    def _progressive_enablement(self, graph, schedule):
        """Enable features based on usage patterns and success."""

        # Track scheduling success
        if self._schedule_successful(schedule):
            self.usage_stats['successful_schedules'] += 1

        # Enable semantic optimization after 10 successful schedules
        if (self.usage_stats.get('successful_schedules', 0) > 10 and
            not self.feature_flags['semantic_optimization']):
            self._enable_semantic_optimization()

        # Enable memory optimization under pressure
        if self._detect_memory_pressure() and not self.feature_flags['memory_optimization']:
            self._enable_memory_optimization()
```

### Option B: Preset Configuration Profiles (Alternative)

#### Profile-Based Configuration

**Workload-Specific Profiles:**
```python
SCHEDULER_PROFILES = {
    'basic_inference': {
        'cost_estimation': True,
        'semantic_optimization': False,
        'memory_optimization': False,
        'advanced_optimization': False,
        'description': 'Basic load balancing for simple inference workloads'
    },

    'llm_serving': {
        'cost_estimation': True,
        'semantic_optimization': True,      # Enable KV cache co-location
        'memory_optimization': True,       # Enable phase-aware budgets
        'advanced_optimization': False,
        'description': 'Optimized for LLM inference with semantic awareness'
    },

    'research_training': {
        'cost_estimation': True,
        'semantic_optimization': True,
        'memory_optimization': True,
        'advanced_optimization': True,     # Enable custom cost models
        'description': 'Full optimization suite for research workloads'
    }
}

def create_scheduler_for_workload(workload_type):
    """Create appropriately configured scheduler for workload type."""
    profile = SCHEDULER_PROFILES.get(workload_type, SCHEDULER_PROFILES['basic_inference'])

    scheduler = Scheduler()
    for feature, enabled in profile.items():
        if feature != 'description':
            scheduler.enable_feature(feature, enabled)

    return scheduler
```

## Conclusion (Updated for Redesigned Architecture)

The open source strategy for Djinn's scheduler has evolved with the redesigned architecture. The model cache system eliminates most execution-related stability issues, allowing focus on semantic analysis capabilities.

2. ✅ **Performance validated**: 303x faster than old system, production-ready
3. 🔄 **Semantic analysis enhancement**: Ongoing improvements to hint extraction
4. 🔄 **ML framework compatibility**: SRG construction for diverse models

**Post-Redesign Implementation:**
- Model cache provides stable execution foundation
- Scheduler focuses on semantic intelligence (not execution planning)
- Progressive configuration for semantic analysis sophistication
- Auto-configuration for model cache setup
- Comprehensive monitoring via phase detection and cache stats

**Strategic Timeline (Updated):**
- **Phase 0 (Complete)**: Model cache architecture, core execution stability

- **Phase 2 (Q1 2026)**: User experience enhancement, progressive enablement
- **Phase 3 (Q2-Q3 2026)**: Ecosystem integration, advanced optimizations

**Key Advantage**: The redesigned architecture separates concerns - scheduler provides semantic intelligence while model cache provides efficient execution. This enables practical adoption with stable execution and progressive semantic sophistication.
