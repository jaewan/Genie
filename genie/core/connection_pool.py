Connection Pool Management

Implements a pool of persistent TCP connections that can be reused across
multiple operations, reducing connection setup overhead.

Features:
- Configurable pool size (1-5 connections)
- Lazy connection creation (create on demand)
- Automatic health checking
- Automatic reconnection on failure
- Async/await support
